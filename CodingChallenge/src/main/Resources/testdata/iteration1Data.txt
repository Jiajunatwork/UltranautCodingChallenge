#This is a coding challenge from Ultranaut.
#Iteration 1
#The tool should verify if a password meets the requirements for a strong password
#• The password must be at least 8 characters in length
#• The password must contain at least 1 letter
#• The password must contain at least 1 number
#
# Analysis: possbile outcomes of different factors
# length: 0, less than 8, 8, greater than 8
# letter count: 0, 1, greater than 1
# number count: 0, 1, greater than 1
#
# note: null = user didnt input password, _ = space or some other random special characters

#  Scenario: password verification app should judge user's password based on the iteration 1 guideline
#    Given User launch the password verification app
#    When user input his password
#    And user clicked on the "check my password" button
#    Then the app should provide a judgement on the password that user entered
#      | password  | outcome |
      | null      | F       |
      | _____     | F       |
