# UltranautCodingChallenge
This branch is a solution to iteration 2 of the utranaut coding challenge. You will need windows OS, Google Chrome, Maven, Java 8, or above to run this project. 
To run this project, you need to install all the dependencies first (by doing a maven clean and install). After having all the dependencies installed, run the "Iteration2Test.java" file as testNG Test. Then the test case for iteration 2 will automatically start itself. 
To check out the password verification app, go to directory src/main/webapp, and run index.html with your default browser. 

The assumption made: empty space(" ") counts as 1 character but does not count as letters.
